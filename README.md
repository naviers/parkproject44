# OCR project for number plate recognition

Due to time constraints i couldn't complete the deployement.
For this project, I used OpenCV for semantic segmentation and CNN for predicting the text.
I trained this model on kaggle ai-indian-license-plate-recognition-data dataset.
It achieved an accuracy of over 99%, I have attached the model weights.
